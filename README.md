# RockPaperScissorsGame_PythonProject
I completed this project using python in Pycharm IDLE.
I Import random library to select the list items randomly.
Use For_loop for range of (1,6) to allow 5 rounds in a game.
Use conditional syntax like if, elif, else.
Use python properties to implement the game.
